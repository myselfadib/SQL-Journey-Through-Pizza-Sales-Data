# SQL-Journey-Through-Pizza-Sales-Data

This repository contains all SQL scripts and documentation for the "Slice of Analysis" project, a detailed exploration of pizza sales data using MySQL. The project spans three stages—basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries—and demonstrates how to transform raw data into actionable business insights through structured query development and analysis.

## Project Structure
- Basic SQL Queries: Scripts for creating and populating database tables. This section sets the foundation for data manipulation by establishing relationships between tables and ensuring data integrity.

- Intermediate SQL Queries: These scripts illustrate the use of JOIN operations to link tables and aggregate functions to calculate total sales per pizza type. This stage advances SQL query skills by extracting complex relationships and performing detailed data analysis.

- Advanced SQL Queries: Featuring the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions, and ranking queries to conduct sophisticated data analyses. This includes sales trend analysis over time, calculation of market share per pizza category, and identification of top-selling products.

- Data Folder: Contains the original CSV files used for importing data into the MySQL database, ensuring reproducibility and ease of access for project reviewers and collaborators.

- Documentation: A comprehensive project report detailing the objectives, processes, key findings, and insights from the data analysis. This document also discusses the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented to address these challenges.

### Features
- Data Import and Setup: Demonstrates how to handle large datasets efficiently using MySQL Workbench.
- Complex SQL Functionalities: Utilizes advanced SQL features such as CTEs, Window Functions, and various types of JOINs to analyze data.
- Analytical Insights: Provides strategic business insights based on data analysis, useful for making informed decisions in a pizza restaurant chain scenario.
- Optimization Techniques: Discusses strategies for optimizing SQL queries to handle large datasets effectively, improving performance and reducing execution times.
